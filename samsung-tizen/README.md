# Instructions

Download the web SDK using `npm`:

```shell
$ npm install
```

Copy the files into your Tizen Studio workspace, open it, and in the `Run` menu, choose the `Tizen Web Simulator Application (Samsung TV)` option under `Run As`. This will run the sample app in the simulator.

The sample app contains two buttons that each log a custom event that triggers a different in-app message. The in-app message will be displayed under the buttons.
